	 <h1>Beam Me Up</h1><hr>
    After smoking the weed they step outside to take in some air and are beamed up onto a spaceship. Still Disoriented from the beam up- they are bombarded by the appearance of small weird looking aliens, kind of dissection robots. However, the chaos and confusion end when an old weed Jedi appears and explains why he took them on the ship. Jedi enlightens them to the galactic cannabis conspiracy and that the weed they smoked was special strain that came from the original cannabis plant. Therefore, they too are now endowed with its Jedi power- inducing cannabinoids. The old weed Jedi tells them that they need go into hyperspace and meet up with his Jedi partner at the rendezvous point.  </p>

	 <h1>It's a Trap</h1><hr>
	 As they enter hyperspace the ship spreads it dissects into different  frequency (light prisms) allowing it to separate the mass into large energy- so they may travel as fast as light.  Suddenly, they come out of light speed only to realize that they are surrounded by an enemy. It’s a trap and they are informed by the enemy that their Jedi partner had already been captured and they are surrounded, so they should give up. The stoner   comes up with the idea of going into light speed mode again, but this time it fails to move. They do it while the enemy fires- allowing the missiles to pass through them. They phase back to a solid mass and the chase begins. They maneuver their small ship into the hanger of the enemy's massive cruiser. As they enter and the weed Jedi jumps out and uses his powers to destroy the main generator. The demon General sends the mind controlling Jedi partner to combat the weed Jedi. The two stoners cover the old man with the gunners on the ship. After a quick battle with the dark Jedi- old Jedi is able to overcome him and destroy the generators. The old man jumps back on board the ship and they jet off into hyperspace to escape.

	 <h1>Rebel HQ</h1><hr>
	 They come out of hyperspace and run a damage check. The ship is not doing well but they have enough energy to get to the rebel home planet. They make it to the rebel base and are introduced to a young female Padawan, who immediately dislikes the two new cannabi-warriors. The old weed Jedi jumps on stage at the council meeting and addresses the crowd. He outlines the ambush and the lost of his partner to the dark side. He then introduces the two as the chosen ones and tells the crowd that they will be the ones to find the seed of eve. Before he can go into details about how they will find and why- the rebel headquarter is ambushed. The weed Jedi escapes with the two stoners and Padawan, however before they can get on the ship, the dark Jedi show up and confronts the weed Jedi.

	 <h1>Traped, De ja Vu</h1><hr>
	 At this point the weed Jedi realizes that full escape is impossible, so he gives a last instruction to the two stoners and instructs his Padawan to protect the seed. The Padawan loyal to her master reluctantly takes on the mission- to protect the stoners and fights to get them out of rebel fortress. Now a bear trap is grasping at their heels. They bust through to the armory grab to hover bikes and with determination break through the barricades. This triggers a high speed chase through the rough outlaw terrain racing to the nearest outlaw town. They try to laser fly through it but the Padwans skills are able to keep the two still novice riders alive.
