	 <h1>Beam Me Up</h1><hr>
    After smoking the weed they step outside to take in some air and are beamed up onto a spaceship. Still Disoriented from the beam up- they are bombarded by the appearance of small weird looking aliens, kind of dissection robots. However, the chaos and confusion end when an old weed Jedi appears and explains why he took them on the ship. Jedi enlightens them to the galactic cannabis conspiracy and that the weed they smoked was special strain that came from the original cannabis plant. Therefore, they too are now endowed with its Jedi power- inducing cannabinoids. The old weed Jedi tells them that they need go into hyperspace and meet up with his Jedi partner at the rendezvous point.  </p>

	 <h1>It's a Trap</h1><hr>
	 As they enter hyperspace the ship spreads it dissects into different  frequency (light prisms) allowing it to separate the mass into large energy- so they may travel as fast as light.  Suddenly, they come out of light speed only to realize that they are surrounded by an enemy. It’s a trap and they are informed by the enemy that their Jedi partner had already been captured and they are surrounded, so they should give up. The stoner   comes up with the idea of going into light speed mode again, but this time it fails to move. They do it while the enemy fires- allowing the missiles to pass through them. They phase back to a solid mass and the chase begins. They maneuver their small ship into the hanger of the enemy's massive cruiser. As they enter and the weed Jedi jumps out and uses his powers to destroy the main generator. The demon General sends the mind controlling Jedi partner to combat the weed Jedi. The two stoners cover the old man with the gunners on the ship. After a quick battle with the dark Jedi- old Jedi is able to overcome him and destroy the generators. The old man jumps back on board the ship and they jet off into hyperspace to escape.

	 <h1>Rebel HQ</h1><hr>
	 They come out of hyperspace and run a damage check. The ship is not doing well but they have enough energy to get to the rebel home planet. They make it to the rebel base and are introduced to a young female Padawan, who immediately dislikes the two new cannabi-warriors. The old weed Jedi jumps on stage at the council meeting and addresses the crowd. He outlines the ambush and the lost of his partner to the dark side. He then introduces the two as the chosen ones and tells the crowd that they will be the ones to find the seed of eve. Before he can go into details about how they will find and why- the rebel headquarter is ambushed. The weed Jedi escapes with the two stoners and Padawan, however before they can get on the ship, the dark Jedi show up and confronts the weed Jedi.   
     </p>

	 <h1>Traped, De ja Vu</h1><hr>
	 At this point the weed Jedi realizes that full escape is impossible, so he gives a last instruction to the two stoners and instructs his Padawan to protect the seed. The Padawan loyal to her master reluctantly takes on the mission- to protect the stoners and fights to get them out of rebel fortress. Now a bear trap is grasping at their heels. They bust through to the armory grab to hover bikes and with determination break through the barricades. This triggers a high speed chase through the rough outlaw terrain racing to the nearest outlaw town. They try to laser fly through it but the Padwans skills are able to keep the two still novice riders alive.

	 <h1>Hans Shot First</h1><hr>
	 The chase goes into the town and they slip into a dive bar. Their immediate look, explains the place- a hodgepodge of aliens and creatures from all sides of the universe. The Padawan walks in unabashed, though the stoners are still rattled from the chase. After talking about the missions and location- they come across an outlaw sitting at a booth chatting up with another patron (Han Solo). Before they can approach- Han suddenly, and without provocation pulls out his gun and fires multiple rounds into the other guy. They stop for a second and then the bar resumes as if nothing happened. The Padawan approaches and speaks to Han with no avail. She presents money and offers herself as a reward, which he accepts and leads them to his ship. They come on board and quickly realize that this is no ordinary ship. Its main cyborg is a beautiful lady and Han’s relationship with her is not coherent. They need to find the seed of eve and then go through the cannabis conspiracy/history. They then need to break the code and find the true locations to the seed of eve.  
     They jet off to one the moon of Jupiter. When they land- they find a cave of wonder. They ask Han to standby and wait for them outside- he reluctantly agrees. The two stoners and the Padawan enter the cave of wonder and have to pass through a variety of tests before reaching the center. 
     </p>

	 <h1>Cave of Truth</h1><hr>
     They 1st walk into a forest full of beauty and wonder; they get so involved in its beauty that they begin to forget- why there are they are there, in the 1st place. Fortunately for them- the Padawan uses the ring as her anchor and finds the exit. The 2nd area is a dark swamp, where they face the most inner demons that have manifested in physical form. They win by switching targets and fighting each other’s demons. The 3rd, are the face off against the guardian, the angel Uriel with wings and a flaming sword. The battle is one sided and Uriel takes on the three with ease, however the two stoner begin to awaken the hidden potential and are now able to fight with Uriel on a even plain.  
     He explains that he knows them and about their journey to find the seed of eve. He lets them pass and proceed to the center. When they arrive they find a space capsule. The capsule can only open, after the two stoners place the hands on it at the same time. It responds to them and opens. It's empty, the seed of eve is no way to be found. A message plays from the empty space responds on computer. It tells the story of EVE and how the original cannabis plant came to be.

	 <h1>Mother Planet</h1><hr>
     It tells of the beginning of the universe and how god made all. Then he created the tree of life/Kabala (aka the Cannabis plant). He then created man, Adam. God next created the angels and he asked one to be his scientist and create new beings and maintain order in the universe. Adam becomes lonely so God created Eve. The scientist seeing this wanted to create his own Eve and through trying failed so he went to God and ask for his own Eve. God said no. Angered he decided to usurp the throne from god and make the universe to his liking. 
     Needing the power of the tree of life to empower himself and army for the upcoming battle, he tricked Eve into letting him take the seed, and then he tells God that it was Adam & Eve who took the seed. God angered disowned Adam & Eve and kick them out of his universe and set them to wonder the unknown for the rest of eternity. Adam & Eve catch onto the scientist plans and come back to infuriate and steal back the seed before Lucifer (Scientist) can use it. In their attempt to escape with the seed, Adam stay behind to hold of Lucifer's army and gives Eve time to use an escape pod to jet off to a far off and unknown planet. 
     Lucifer defeats Adam but without the seed his army will fail, so follows her pod to the unknown planet. When he arrives he finds that Eve has created an army of using the seed to empower the natives of the planet. The powers of the seed and Eve’s training help them to evolve into highly spiritual and intelligent beings. With the beings help- Eve is able to put up a counter attack and defend the planet and the seed. She gets mortally wounded by Lucifer; however God show up after defeating the rest of Lucifer's army. He defeats Lucifer and locks him in a black hole in the center of the universe. 
     Unfortunately Eve is already passed, but God lets the sons and daughters of Eve live in repents for falsely accusing them of stealing the seed. He leaves the galaxy and the beings go on living. However the demon Lucifer gets stronger in his cage and start leaking his dark energy onto the planet. At 1st the people of the planet defend but slowly the dark energy start winning. He converts one after another and creates concepts like money and pharmaceuticals- to further warp people's minds and get them away from spirituality and the truth. 
     Finally, over thousands of years he starts to win and begins to eliminate the cannabis plant and spirituality from the human race. Greed, money and pills now take over the minds of the people. However, one small select group of Canna activists knows the truth and continues to fight this evil. The truth is passed down the secret of Eve and the true nature of the Cannabis plant is protected by guardians. Bob Marley, being one of the guardians and our weed Jedi (Tommy Chong) being the latest. 
     The message ends here. Now finally getting to the seed of eve but failing to find it and only left with an empty box. The stoners are devastated. They argue on whether to fight, run, surrender? They agree that all they can do is fight and they hatch up an half cooked plan to sneak in the enemy cruiser and free the weed Jedis and fight back against the general and prevent them from eliminating the Cannabis plant. They come out of the cave of wonder only to find that the Republican Army is outside waiting for them. Han sold them out for profit, the Padawan has some choice words for him, before they are taken onboard.

	 <h1>It's trap, Again, Again!!</h1><hr>
     They are taken on the main cruiser and imprisoned. The female 3cpo sneak into the jail cell and breaks them out. They sneakily make the way up to the control room where the two weed Jedi are hooked up to a machine that uses them as a catapult to detect all cannabinoids in the known universe. It starts processing the cannabinoid levels in the universe and when it hits 100% a button can be pushed that will eliminate all cannabinoids.  
     The three canna warriors slip in unnoticed but quickly get discovered, with only a couple of minute to spare- one of the stoners take on the general as the padawan defends against guards and the other stoner takes to the weed Jedi trying to figure away to turn off the machine. As the two fight continues and time running out the stoner with goodies from the weed Jedi, stoners finds that they can reverse the machine purpose and instead of finding and eliminating it finds- it can bring cannabinoids.

	 <h1>Weed Jedi Unite</h1><hr>
     When he hits the button, the machine beams high level cannabinoid users (AKA Snoop Dogg, Willie Nelson, Sarah Silverman, Vivi Mickpeac, Steve Deangelo etc) as reinforcements to the cursor. A massive weed Jedi fight breaks out, the high level cannabis users empower weed Jedi status and help turn the tide of the battle. 
     Just as it seems that they are going to win. The black hole in the center of the galaxy opens up and Lucifer appears. This God like demon shadow engulfs the planet itself. Without the seed of Eve there is no hope… however Tommy reveals that the two warriors are in fact the seed of Eve. They hold within them the bloodline of Eve herself. Eve mated with one of the natives and the bloodline of eve runs in their veins. 
     The weed Jedi gathers around the two warriors and give them some of the chakra. The two stoners become super Saiyans and fly off to duel with Lucifer- as the seed of Eve proficient. However even with all the extra chakra- they are still under matched. Tommy gets the idea to ask the earth and all the people for some of their energy. He grabs the machine and turns up the energy range and begins to speak to everyone with cannabinoids (which we all have because we create our own cannabinoids: the endocannabinoid system).  
     Everyone hears Tommy Chong plea for them to “understand that there is a war going on right above the head and even though they can't see it or might not believe it that war is going on regardless”. He asked them to raise their hands and give some of the energy so that the seeds of Eve may use their energy. People respond and send their energy, the two stoners suddenly receive a massive amount of energy and are able to convert it into a final attack, that seals Lucifer back into the black hole. The world celebrates the victors. The two stoners return to the ship and receive praise from all over.
