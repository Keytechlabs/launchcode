	 <h1>Give us your energy</h1><hr>
      Just as it seems that they are going to win. The black hole in the center of the galaxy opens up and Lucifer appears. This God like demon shadow engulfs the planet itself. Without the seed of Eve there is no hope… however Tommy reveals that the two warriors are in fact the seed of Eve. They hold within them the bloodline of Eve herself. Eve mated with one of the natives and the bloodline of eve runs in their veins. 
      The weed Jedi gathers around the two warriors and give them some of the chakra. The two stoners become super Saiyans and fly off to duel with Lucifer- as the seed of Eve proficient. However even with all the extra chakra- they are still under matched. Tommy gets the idea to ask the earth and all the people for some of their energy. He grabs the machine and turns up the energy range and begins to speak to everyone with cannabinoids (which we all have because we create our own cannabinoids: the endocannabinoid system).  
      Everyone hears Tommy Chong plea for them to “understand that there is a war going on right above the head and even though they can't see it or might not believe it that war is going on regardless”. He asked them to raise their hands and give some of the energy so that the seeds of Eve may use their energy. People respond and send their energy, the two stoners suddenly receive a massive amount of energy and are able to convert it into a final attack, that seals Lucifer back into the black hole. The world celebrates the victors. The two stoners return to the ship and receive praise from all over.

	 <h1>Sharing the Love</h1><hr>
     Months later a much different earth is seen; one with peace love and harmony. No more polluting the planet, hemp houses, oil and clothing. Not hip parades but a functional word with hemp and cannabis at the center. A world full of hope. All are played out to “One love” as we watch the images of a Hemp earth. 	 </p>
